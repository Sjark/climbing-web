 * is consistent, by whatever is requested in the event.
 *
 * This is a bit aggressive, but until we get the data consistency under
 * control, this is the simplest way to ensure that the UI remains correct. In
 * the future, we should be able to use {@code @tanstack/react-query}'s
 * functionalities to directly update the cache after mutations. However, that
 * day is not today, and the side-effects are too deeply-wired to invalidate
 * query-by-query.
 *
 * So, here we are!
